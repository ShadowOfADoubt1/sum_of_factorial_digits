**Notes:**
The tarball contains a python virtual envirorment so as to eliminate the #warning. The git repo does not have a python virtual environment due to the large amount of files that needs to be uploaded to the git repo. 

If you create the docker container from repot it will still run but might print #warning. If you want to avoid this warning run the follwoing commands in the terminal first (for linux systems):

1. python3 -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
